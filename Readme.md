# Columns layout examples

Here you have example how to use auto flex column in row element:

```html
<div class="row">
   <div class="auto columns">Auto</div>
</div>
```

So you can use auto column or auto columns class to add one, two or more column and
they adjust automaticly with flexbox. You can use static options for column size
like: one column, two columns, three columns, four columns, five columns, six columns,
seven columns, eight columns, nine columns, ten columns, eleven columns, twelve columns,
one-third column, two-third column and one-half column.

```html
<div class="row">
   <div class="one-third column">One Third</div>
   <div class="two-third column">Two Third</div>
</div>
```
